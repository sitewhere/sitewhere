Device Groups
=============
Device groups are used to create an association between related devices. A device can 
belong to any number of groups and there is no limit to the size of a group. Device 
groups can also contain other device groups. Each element (device or subgroup) in a 
device group can have zero or more roles assigned. This allows external applications to 
query a device group and get a list of devices that serve a given role or roles, then take 
actions such as issuing commands or updating metadata.
